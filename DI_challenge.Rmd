This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
temp <- con_fin_data
temp$Date.received <- as.Date(temp$Date.received,  "%m/%d/%Y")

# Plot 1: Increase in reported complaints over years

ggplot(agg_year, aes(year, total)) + geom_line() + labs(y = "total complaints received")

# Plot2: No of customers disputed

ggplot(temp, aes(Consumer.disputed.)) + 
                   geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..))) + 
                   scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
                   ylab("relative frequencies") + 
                   theme_bw()

sum(temp$Consumer.disputed. == "Yes")/ nrow(temp)


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
